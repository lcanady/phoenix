#@alias

Ayntax: @alias <player> = <name>

Provides an alternate name by which the player is known. The alternate name is only used for players when referenced as commands that only take playernames (such as page or @stats). You may not set an alias on any other object type.

When setting an alias, the alias is checked to see that it is both a legal player name and not already in use Only if both checks succeed is the alias set.
